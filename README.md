**kariSpark** is a cross-platform desktop and CLI tool for downloading, uploading, and transferring programs between microcontrollers.  
It is designed to make working with embedded devices simple and efficient.  

Currently, kariSpark CLI supports AVR-based MCUs (such as ATmega328P and ATmega2560).  
kariSpark Desktop supports AVR-based MCUs and adds ESP32 support starting from version 1.1.0.

1. Download the CLI binary from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vincentmuriithi/kariSpark/releases)**
2. Add the binary to your system `PATH` to use it globally

#### 🐧 Linux
**Option A – Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i kariSpark_CLI.deb
```
**Option B – Manual binary**
```bash
# Download the CLI binary from GitHub Releases
sudo mv karispark /usr/local/bin/
```

Check installation:
```bash
karispark --version
```

## 🛠 Command Reference
```bash

## 🔄 Updates
kariSpark Desktop supports in-app updates.
New versions can be installed directly from the application when available.  
CLI releases are distributed separately through GitHub Releases.


## 🔨 Usage
### karispark doctor
Used to inspect your environment and install required dependencies to get you started on **kariSpark**.  
Syntax:
```bash
karispark doctor
```

### karispark init
Used to generate **kari.toml** config file for use with **kariSpark**.  
The ***kari.toml*** file is used to add configurations to your project or work instead of passing the parameters on the cli each time you run a given command.  
Syntax:
```bash
karispark init
```

### karispark detect
Used to detect the connected boards in your pc.  
Syntax:
```bash
karispark detect
```

### karispark upload
Used to upload programs to connected boards. Requires the port to be specified when flashing to single board but also supports parallel flashing for uploading multiple boards.  
For single board you use:
```bash
karispark upload port <options>
```
Example:
```bash
karispark upload COM3 --board uno --programmer arduino --dir . 
```
For multiple board uploading also known as parallel flashing is as:
```bash
karispark upload --parallel <options>
```
In parallel flashing port is not needed and if you pass it it will be ignored. 
This command usage is as follows:
```bash
Arguments:
[PORT]
Options:
  -b, --board <BOARD>
  -p, --programmer <PROGRAMMER>
  -d, --dir <DIR>
      --parallel
  -h, --help                     Print help
  ```

  ### karispark download
  Used to download programs to connected boards. Requires the port to be specified when downloading the program with an exception only when using usbasp as the programmer.
  It also allows for one to specify a directory where the downloaded program will be saved. If not saved it will be saved in the temp directory.
  
  Syntax:
  ```bash
  karispark download port <options>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  karispark /dev/ttyACM0 -b mega2560 --programmer arduino  -d "./downloaded_program"
  ```
  This command usage is as follows:
  ```bash
  Arguments:
  [PORT]

Options:
  -b, --board <BOARD>
  -d, --dir <DIR>
  -p, --programmer <PROGRAMMER>
  -h, --help                     Print help
  ```

  ### karispark transfer
  This is the most powerful and unique feature of ***kariSpark***.
  It's used to transfer program between boards of same MCU architecture e.g atmega328 to atmega328. It requires the source port and target port to be specified when transferring programs between two boards.

  It also supports multiple board program transfer also know as parallel transfer. It works by single source multiple targets strategy.

  The term parallel isn't just sugar-coating, but an explanation of how the transfer works. **kariSpark** spawns multiple threads in which each transfer/upload during the transaction has its own thread hence saving transfer and upload times when transferring to multiple devices. Hence transfers occur concurrently instead of waiting for one board to finish before starting the next.

  Two boards transfer signature is as follows:
  ```bash
  karispark transfer source_port target_port <options>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  karispark transfer COM3 COM4 -b uno -p arduino 
  ```
  In parallel transfer you only need specify the ***source_port*** only.
  ```bash
  karispark source_port --parallel <options>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  karispark transfer COM14 --parallel --programmer arduino --board leonardo
  ```
This command usage is as follows:
```bash
Arguments:
  [SOURCE_PORT]
  [TARGET_PORT]

Options:
  -b, --board <BOARD>
  -p, --programmer <PROGRAMMER>
      --parallel
  -h, --help                     Print help
  ```

### karispark verify
Used to verify the correctness of a program in a given microcontroller and also comparing if a given saved program file is same as one running in a given MCU.
Syntax:
```bash
karispark verify port <options>
```
Example:
```bash
karispark verify COM15 -b attiny85 -p arduino --file ./saved_program.hex
```
You also just pass a directory to file and it will automatically search in that directory for the saved program with the name ***temp_program.hex*** for AVR MCUs. If you don't give the path   or file it will check it in the temp directory.

The port argument is optional when using usbasp programmer.

This command usage is as follows:
```bash
Arguments:
  [PORT]

Options:
  -f, --file <FILE>
  -b, --board <BOARD>            [default: uno]
  -p, --programmer <PROGRAMMER>  [default: arduino]
  -h, --help                     Print help
  ```
