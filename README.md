**kariSpark** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for downloading, uploading, and transferring programs between microcontrollers.  
It is designed to make working with embedded devices simple and efficient.  

Currently, kariSpark supports **AVR-based MCUs** (such as ATmega328P, ATmega2560, etc.), with plans for broader MCU family support in the future.
